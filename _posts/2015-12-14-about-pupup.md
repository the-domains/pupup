PupUp Studio is an experimental project investigating the running of a
commercial canine photography studio. Using a temporary space in the 
Brixton Academy, London SW9 9SL, we're experimenting with new 
techniques, technology and work-flow, to streamline the production of 
high quality portraiture and product shots. This increases our volume, 
and lowers your costs, while ensuring our stringent quality standards 
continue to be met.

When [Dogstar Photo][0]
needed a studio in the past, we've ether hired one, or built one. 
Having a dedicated space for the project provides consistancy across 
shoots, and allows us the flexibility to shoot a variety of dogs and pet
products in a controlled environment. We're experimenting with other 
aspects of the project too, such as booking and pricing. We are hopeful
that the endeavour will result in better insights into our target 
demographics, and a more fulfilling service for our customers.

The photographic experience at PupUp Studio is both exciting and 
rewarding. Dogs are transformed, through high key fashion images in the
tradition of Bailey and Rankin, into stars, then immortalised as 
timeless large-format wall art for future generations to treasure. Our 
principal photographer is [Ian Morrison][1], professional dog photographer and founder of [Dogstar Photo][2].
90% of Ian's photographs are of dogs, and while skilled in other areas
of photography, his main interest is photographing dogs and their 
world, including the people, places, and products that define them.
